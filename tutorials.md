# Tutorials

You can explore some of DeepNeuro's futures with tutorials run in Google's Colab. Colab is browser-based program that you can use to run Python code, install external software packages, and use graphics processing units (GPUs) for free via virtual machines provided by Google. This means that you can run DeepNeuro code in _notebooks_ created in Colab without having to worry about installing DeepNeuro first, and without having to worry about finding the GPUs necessary to run neural networks efficiently on medical imaging data.

Check out some of the tutorials here:
