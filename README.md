# DeepNeuro

A deep learning python package for neuroimaging data. Focused on validated command-line tools you can use today. Created by the Quantitative Tumor Imaging Lab at the Martinos Center (Harvard-MIT Program in Health, Sciences, and Technology / Massachusetts General Hospital).

## About
DeepNeuro is an open-source toolset of deep learning applications for neuroimaging. We have several goals for this package:

* Provide easy-to-use command line tools for neuroimaging using deep learning.
* Create Docker containers for each tool and all out-of-package pre-processing steps, so they can each can be run without having install prerequisite libraries.
* Provide freely available deep learning models trained on a wealth of neuroimaging data.
* Provide training scripts and links to publically-available data to replicate the results of DeepNeuro's models.
* Provide implementations of popular models for medical imaging data, and pre-processed datasets for educational purposes.

This package is under active development, but we encourage users to both try the modules with pre-trained modules highlighted below, and try their hand at making their own DeepNeuro modules using the tutorials below.

## Installation

1. Install Docker from Docker's website here: https://www.docker.com/get-started. Follow instructions on that link to get Docker set up properly on your workstation.

2. Install the Docker Engine Utility for NVIDIA GPUs, AKA nvidia-docker. You can find installation instructions at their Github page, here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

3. Pull the DeepNeuro Docker container from https://hub.docker.com/r/qtimlab/deepneuro_segment_gbm/. Use the command "docker pull qtimlab/deepneuro"

4. If you want to run DeepNeuro outside of a Docker container, you can install the DeepNeuro Python package locally using the pip package manager. On the command line, run ```pip install deepneuro```
